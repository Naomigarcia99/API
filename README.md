API Project: Jokes for workers
This project is an interactive web application that uses multiple APIs to display jokes and the weather in Barcelona. Users can check the weather before starting their workday and enjoy a couple of randomly selected jokes, which they can rate to measure the overall mood.

## Introduction
The app is designed for workers who want to start the day with a smile and check the weather in Barcelona. Three APIs are used to fetch the data:

- [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) for dad jokes.
- [Chuck Norris Jokes](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random) for Chuck Norris jokes.
- [Wttr.in](https://wttr.in/Barcelona?format=j1) to display real-time weather in Barcelona.
Users can rate the jokes, allowing the app to track workers' mood based on the scores given.
